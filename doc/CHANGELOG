* Started adding support for XML configuration files to describe the anonymization
  policy. View /applications/example_policy.xml for a sample policy and further explanation.

* Added support for anonymization of binary payloads. Payloads identified at the moment include:
	Stuttgart decoder, Wuerzburg decoder, generic wget requests on a shell, Konstanz decoder,
	and other various XOR decoders. See the nepenthes project page for more information.

* Fixed some restrictions which prevented prefix-preserving anonymization from being
  applied on the "next hop" fields for Netflow v5 and v9.
