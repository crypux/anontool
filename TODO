# TODO list

* Documentation
    - Doxygen for code?

* If flist is used in the fastpath, use a pool allocator rather than malloc [although
  I am able to rely on popular malloc implementations to be somewhat clever]
* Get rid of all the magic numbers in the code.
* Get rid of all the non-standard types, use exact width types from stdint.h where needed.
* Get rid of all the standard random functions. Instead, use MT (already
  implemented) as input to all functions which produce a distribution.

* Finish stream6, get rid of libnids.

* Binary payload matchers are OUTDATED. I have to figure out what to do with that
  feature..

* Measure PIC version on x86. If it's significantly slower, try to compile
  a non-PIC version and see what happens. (WTB TIME)

* Configurable keys for AES/3DES (prefix-preserving anon)
    - Current setup is just plain shit.

* Add support for SCTP (primarily for IPFIX transport), GRE, L2TP, GTP, etc.

* Implement IPv6 and IPsec decoding. (IPX? Is that used *at all* anymore?)

* Implement some metric of assessing the achieved anonymization levels
depending on the functions/parameters used. Bibliography read...this stuff
is a whole year of research on its own.
