* Documentation
	- Doxygen for code?
	- XML config was a bad idea from the start. Something more usable like a JSON
	format would be nicer.

* Get rid of all the magic numbers in the code.
* Get rid of all the non-standard types, use exact width types from stdint.h where needed.
* Get rid of all the standard random functions. Instead, use MT (already
  implemented) as input to all functions which produce a distribution.

* Finish stream6, get rid of libnids.

* Binary payload matchers are way outdated. I have to figure out what to do with that
  feature..

* Measure PIC version on x86. If it's significantly slower, try to compile
  a non-PIC version and see what happens. (WTB TIME)

* Configurable keys for AES/3DES (prefix-preserving anon)
	- If the recent attacks on 10-round 256-bit AES get any better, we might have to
	  at least emit some warning?

* Add support for SCTP (primarily for IPFIX transport), GRE, L2TP, GTP, etc.

* Implement IPv6 and IPX decoding.

* Implement some metric of assessing the achieved anonymization levels
depending on the functions/parameters used. Bibliography?

* I might need to get a domain for this. FORTH has completely ditched this as a project,
  and they're not willing to maintain/develop it any further.
