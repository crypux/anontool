* Documentation
	- Doxygen for code?
	- XML config was a bad idea from the start. Something more usable like a JSON
	format would be nicer.

* Get rid of all the magic numbers in the code.
* Get rid of all the non-standard types.
* Get rid of all the standard random functions. Instead, use MT (already
  implemented) as input to all functions which produce a distribution.

* Finish stream6, get rid of libnids.

* Binary payload matchers are way outdated. I have to figure out what to do with that
  feature..

* Measure PIC version on x86. If it's significantly slower, try to compile
  a non-PIC version and see what happens. (WTB TIME)

* Configurable key for AES/3DES (prefix-preserving anon)
	- Implement in anonymization_functions.c
	- Move the call to aes_set_key()/des3_set_3keys() to an appropriate spot, to only
	  be called once.
	- aes_init() -> update key in anonflow & call aes_set_key()
	- If the recent attacks on 10-round 256-bit AES get any better, we might have to
	  at least emit some warning?

* Implement IPFIX file as input source (if anybody needs this..)

* Add SCTP support (primarily for IPFIX transport).

* Implement some metric of assessing the achieved anonymization levels
depending on the functions/parameters used.

* I really need to get a domain for this. FORTH has completely ditched this as a project,
  and they're not willing to maintain/develop it any further. Not me, though. :-)
