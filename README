# anontool - an open source anonymization tool


# DEPENDS
Anontool depends on the following:
(Ubuntu aptitude packages used as a reference)
    - libglib2.0-dev
    - libnet1-dev
    - libpcre3, libpcre3-dev
    - libpcap0.8-dev

# COMPILATION

    - Just type 'make' :-)
    - See below for some important usage notes.

# NOTES - USAGE

    - /lib/anonlib.so is the shared library containing the implementation
    of the anonymization framework. Applications are linking onto this
    library.

    - In the /applications/ folder, 3 small apps are provided.

    - Anontool depends on libnids. For the user's convenience, a fairly
    customized version is included under /lib/libnids/. Currently, I'm
    not considering including a make rule for newer versions of libnids.
    However, bear in mind that /lib/libnids/src/libnids.so.1.21 MUST BE
    visible from your loader when attempting to execute an application -
    the simplest way to do that is setting your library path accordingly.

    - For more information on what you can do with the sample applications
    have a look in /doc/README.
